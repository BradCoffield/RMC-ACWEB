      <p class="dept-intro-text">Rocky Mountain College’s biology program provides opportunities for
        students to explore the diversity of the biological discipline while training for <a href="#career-pathways-biology">future careers</a>.
        We’re a small school where students become familiar with <a href="#bio-faculty-cards-section">approachable professors</a> who are experts
        in ecology, evolution, biochemistry, microbiology, virology, genetics, and molecular biology. The
        combination of small class sizes and diverse faculty creates a program where students grow into
        well-rounded biologists equipped for future success. Our students have gone on to become MD’s,
        PA’s, PhD’s, and numerous other successful
        professionals.</p>

                Recently, our program benefitted from the opening of the state-of-the-art Charles Morledge
                Science Building. These new laboratories enhance students’ experiential educational
                opportunities. A required capstone experience in this space represents the culmination of the
                biology major with students engaged in research-focused studies in ecology, molecular
                biology, or
                virology. When students graduate from Rocky Mountain College’s biology program, they have a
                broad
                understanding of the discipline, while being skilled researchers capable of conducting and
                interpreting experiments.</p>
